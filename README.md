## Block 3: Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

This block is divided into five tasks, each addressing different aspects of deep learning:

1. **Task 1**: Creation of a custom neural network.
2. **Task 2**: Experiments and evaluation on various setups and parameters.
3. **Task 3**: Interpretability analysis of the neural networkâ€™s decisions.
4. **Task 4**: Application of transfer learning techniques.
5. **Task 5**: Open project focusing on satellite image classification using a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification/).

- **Contents**:
  - **Project Proposal**: Describes the tasks, objectives, and methodologies (available in PDF format).
  - **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contains solutions and implementations for all tasks.
  - **Project Report**: Summarizes the findings and provides insights.
